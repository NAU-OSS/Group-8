We develop small programs to handle mathematical functions involving floating point math for devices that can only handle integers.
Our goal is to continue making useful programs for devices that don't have the exact hardware for the task, so if you know of some functionality  
you think would be helpful, feel free to submit a pull request following our contributing guidelines.

Our current code which is named as 'Math Function' implemented in C language. you should compile C in your machine to use this code.
This code is the arithmatic math operation 'add and subtract'.

It gets 2 numbers which could be an integer or real numbers. These numbers have 2 parts: the characteristic and mantissa. for example, in 5.765, 
characteristic is 5 and mantissa is 765 over 1000.  

Our code needs 3 inputs for each number. 1- Characteristic 2- numerator of the mantissa 3-and denominator of the mantissa.  
Our code return a character which is the result of add or subtract of the two numbers.
